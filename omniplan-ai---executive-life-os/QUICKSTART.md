# Quick Start - Using Your New Week-Isolated Planner

## 🎯 What's Different?

Your planner is now **week-based** instead of global. Each week has its own:
- Business goals
- Personal/well-being goals
- Daily focus for each day
- To-do lists per day
- Meetings
- Events/time blocks
- Habits tracked

**Key Point**: Changing one week doesn't affect other weeks!
